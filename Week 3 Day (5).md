<h2>  CloudWatch </h2>


- Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service built for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers, IT managers, and product owners.
- CloudWatch provides us with data and actionable insights to monitor our applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, and optimize resource utilization.
- CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events.
- Get a unified view of operational health and gain complete visibility of our AWS resources, applications, and services running on AWS and on-premises

<h3> Advantages </h3>

<h3> Single platform to observe </h3>

CloudWatch allows us to collect, access, and correlate this data on a single platform from across all your AWS resources, applications, and services running on AWS and on-premises, helping us break down data silos to gain system-wide visibility and quickly resolve issue.

<h3> Collect Metrics </h3>

- CloudWatch natively integrates with more than 70 AWS services.
- Publishes detailed one-minute metrics and custom metrics.
- Automatically publishes detailed one-minute metrics and custom metrics with up to one-second granularity.

<h3> Improve Operational Performance </h3>

- Set alarms and automate actions based on predefined thresholds.
- Example: Starting Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically or stop an instance to reduce billing overages.
- We can also use CloudWatch Events for serverless to trigger workflows.


<h3> Operational Visibility </h3>

- Unified operational view.
- Real-time granular data.
- Historical reference.
- Provides automatic dashboards, data with one-second granularity, and up to 15 months of metrics storage and retention.
- Can  perform metric math on our data to derive operational and utilization insights.

<h3> Executable insights from logs </h3>

- Explore, analyze, and visualize logs.
- Troubleshoot operational problems with ease.
- Scales with our log volume and query complexity, giving us answers in seconds.
- Dashboards for complete operational visibility.
- We can publish log-based metrics, create alarms, and correlate logs and metrics together in CloudWatch.



<h3> Working </h3> 

CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events, and visualizes it using automated dashboards so we can get a unified view of our AWS resources, applications, and services that run on AWS and on premises.

We can visualize the experience of our application end users and validate design choices through experimentation. Correlate our metrics and logs to better understand the health and performance of our resources. Create alarms based on metric value thresholds we specify, or alarm.

<h3> Use Cases </h3>

<h3> Monitor Application Performance </h3>
  
  
<h3> Perform Root Cause Analysis </h3>
Analyze metrics logs and analytics & user requests in order to reduce mean time and speed up debugging.

<h3> Optimize resources Efficiently</h3>
Automate resource usage and planning while setting up some actions to perform with threshold when triggered it execute those actions which can be based on AI, machine learning, specifications.

<h3>Test Website Impacts </h3>
Looks for impact by when and how long by viewing screenshots, logs, and web requests at any point in time.


<h2> CloudTrial </h2>

AWS CloudTrail monitors and records account activity across your AWS infrastructure, giving you control over storage, analysis, and remediation actions.

<h3> Benefits </h3>

- Protect our organization from penalties using CloudTrail logs to prove compliance with regulations.
- Take/improve security measures by recording user activity and events, and set up automated workflow rules with Amazon EventBridge.
- Capture and consolidate user activity and API usage across AWS Regions and accounts on a single, centrally controlled platform.

<h3> Different Use Cases </h3>


<b> Inspect activity </b>

Monitor, store, and validate activity events for authenticity and generate audit reports

<b>Troubleshoot operational issues </b>

Detect unauthorized access using the Who, What, and When information in CloudTrail Events. Respond with rules-based EventBridge alerts and automated workflows.

<b>Identify security incidents </b>

Continuously monitor API usage history using machine learning models to spot unusual activity in our AWS accounts, and finds root cause.
