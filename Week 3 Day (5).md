<h2>  CloudWatch </h2>

<h3> Single platform to observe </h3>

CloudWatch allows us to collect, access, and correlate this data on a single platform from across all your AWS resources, applications, and services running on AWS and on-premises, helping us break down data silos to gain system-wide visibility and quickly resolve issue.

<h3> Collect Metrics </h3>

- CloudWatch natively integrates with more than 70 AWS services.
- Publishes detailed one-minute metrics and custom metrics.
- Automatically publishes detailed one-minute metrics and custom metrics with up to one-second granularity.

<h3> Improve Operational Performance </h3>

- Set alarms and automate actions based on predefined thresholds.
- Example: Starting Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically or stop an instance to reduce billing overages.
- We can also use CloudWatch Events for serverless to trigger workflows.


<h3> Operational Visibility </h3>

- Unified operational view.
- Real-time granular data.
- Historical reference.
- Provides automatic dashboards, data with one-second granularity, and up to 15 months of metrics storage and retention.
- Can  perform metric math on our data to derive operational and utilization insights.

<h3> Executable insights from logs </h3>

- Explore, analyze, and visualize logs.
- Troubleshoot operational problems with ease.
- Scales with our log volume and query complexity, giving you answers in seconds.
- Dashboards for complete operational visibility.
- We can publish log-based metrics, create alarms, and correlate logs and metrics together in CloudWatch.



<h3> Working </h3> 

CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events, and visualizes it using automated dashboards so you can get a unified view of your AWS resources, applications, and services that run on AWS and on premises.

We can visualize the experience of our application end users and validate design choices through experimentation. Correlate our metrics and logs to better understand the health and performance of our resources. Create alarms based on metric value thresholds we specify, or alarm.
