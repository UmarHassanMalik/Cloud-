<h3> Cloud Computing </h3>

Cloud computing is on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider such as AWS, Azure, google cloud.

AWS offers numerous services which are required commonly across all the businesses. For example My SQL, Mongo DB databases.

<h3> Client Server Model </h3>
Basically, A client can be a web browser or an application through which a user/person interacts to make requests to servers. A server can be on premisis or a public cloud running as EC2 on AWS or on any other cloud provider i.e Azure, Google cloud etc.  

A client (web browser) makes a request for a file (i.e picture, video etc.) to server and then server evaluates the details and respond the request accordingly. 

<h3> Deployment Models </h3>

There are three cloud computing deployment models.

- Cloud-based
- On-premises
- Hybrid. 

<h3> Cloud-based Deployment </h3>

- Run whole application on cloud.
- We can migrate our application to cloud.
- We can build new applications on cloud.

<h3> Hybrid Deployment </h3>

Cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure.  For example, we have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, banks, military or government regulations require our business to keep certain records on premises.

<h3> On Premisis Deployment </h3>
It is a private cloud deployment. Resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization technologies and resource management tools.

<h3> Advantages of Cloud Computing </h3>

<h3> Accessability </h3>
We can deploy our application to different parts of the world .If we are located in a different part of the world than your customers, customers are able to access your applications with minimal delays.

<h3> Better Performance & Felxibility </h3>
flexibility provides us with more time to experiment and innovate. When computing in data centers, it may take weeks to obtain new resourceswhich we need. Cloud computing enables us to access new resources within short time.

<h3> Capacity Guess </h3>
We dont need to speculate that how much infrastructure capacity we will need before deploying an application.
For instance, we can launch Amazon EC2 instances when needed, and pay only for the compute time that we use.


<h3> No headache of maintaining and running data centers </h3>

Computing in data centers requires us to spend more money and time managing infrastructure and servers on the other hand, cloud computing allows us to focus less on these tasks and more on our applications and clients.
