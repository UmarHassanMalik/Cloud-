<h2> Coursera Modules </h2>

<h2> MODULE 1 </h2>

<h3> Cloud Computing </h3>

Cloud computing is on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider such as AWS, Azure, google cloud.

AWS offers numerous services which are required commonly across all the businesses. For example My SQL, Mongo DB databases.

<h3> Client Server Model </h3>
Basically, A client can be a web browser or an application through which a user/person interacts to make requests to servers. A server can be on premisis or a public cloud running as EC2 on AWS or on any other cloud provider i.e Azure, Google cloud etc.  

A client (web browser) makes a request for a file (i.e picture, video etc.) to server and then server evaluates the details and respond the request accordingly. 

<h3> Deployment Models </h3>

There are three cloud computing deployment models.

- Cloud-based
- On-premises
- Hybrid. 

<h3> Cloud-based Deployment </h3>

- Run whole application on cloud.
- We can migrate our application to cloud.
- We can build new applications on cloud.

<h3> Hybrid Deployment </h3>

Cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure.  For example, we have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, banks, military or government regulations require our business to keep certain records on premises.

<h3> On Premisis Deployment </h3>
It is a private cloud deployment. Resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization technologies and resource management tools.

<h3> Advantages of Cloud Computing </h3>

<h3> Accessability </h3>
We can deploy our application to different parts of the world .If we are located in a different part of the world than your customers, customers are able to access your applications with minimal delays.

<h3> Better Performance & Felxibility </h3>
flexibility provides us with more time to experiment and innovate. When computing in data centers, it may take weeks to obtain new resourceswhich we need. Cloud computing enables us to access new resources within short time.

<h3> Capacity Guess </h3>
We dont need to speculate that how much infrastructure capacity we will need before deploying an application.
For instance, we can launch Amazon EC2 instances when needed, and pay only for the compute time that we use.


<h3> No headache of maintaining and running data centers </h3>

Computing in data centers requires us to spend more money and time managing infrastructure and servers on the other hand, cloud computing allows us to focus less on these tasks and more on our applications and clients.



<h2> MODULE 2 </h2>

<h3> EC2 </h3>

- Amazon EC2 or Elastic compute cloud allows user to rent virtual computer on which they can run their own applications.
- EC2 provides scalable deployment of an application through a service (Auto scaling); in which a user can boot a Amazon machine image to configure a virtual machine.
- A user can create as many virtual machines as he needs and paying by a second of active servers.

<h3> Traditional Approach </h3>

- Costs upfront to purchase hardware.
- Wait for the servers to be delivered.
- Installing servers in our data centers.
- Setting of servers configuration.

<h3> Using AWS EC2 </h3>

- Launch Amazon EC2 instance(s) within minutes.
- Pay for server capacity that we need or want.
- Pay only for server capacity that we need or want. no cost for the terminated/stopped instances.
- Stop using it when we have finished running a workload.


<h3> Steps to Use EC2 </h3>

<h3> Launch </h3>

First, we launch an instance by selecting a template with basic configurations for our instance. The configurations can be related to OS, application, server, instance type.

<h3> Connect </h3>

After that we connect to the instance which can be done in different ways. Oour programs and applications have multiple different methods to connect directly to the instance and exchange data i.e login/ accessing through PC.

<h3> Use </h3>

After connecting to the instance we can run commands/scripts to install software, add storage, copy and organize files etc.


<h3> Instances Types </h3>

There are several types of EC2 instances.

<h3> General purpose instances </h3>

General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources. We can use them to handle variety of workloads such as.

application servers

gaming servers

backend servers for enterprise applications

small and medium databases

<h3> Compute optimized instances </h3>

Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors.
we use them in  areas like web, application, and gaming servers.

<h3> Memory optimized instances </h3>
  
Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory.
Exmple: We can handle a workload that requires large amounts of data to be preloaded before running an application such as high-performance database or a workload that involves performing real-time processing of a large amount of unstructured data.

<h3> Accelerated computing instances </h3>

Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators, or coprocessors, to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs
