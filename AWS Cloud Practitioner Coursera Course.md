<h3> Cloud Computing </h3>

Cloud computing is on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider such as AWS, Azure, google cloud.

AWS offers numerous services which are required commonly across all the businesses. For example My SQL, Mongo DB databases.

<h3> Client Server Model </h3>
Basically, A client can be a web browser or an application through which a user/person interacts to make requests to servers. A server can be on premisis or a public cloud running as EC2 on AWS or on any other cloud provider i.e Azure, Google cloud etc.  

A client (web browser) makes a request for a file (i.e picture, video etc.) to server and then server evaluates the details and respond the request accordingly.
