<h2>What is Cloud</h2>


A cloud is basically a datacenter full of virtual servers connected to the internet or we can say; it is a communications network.

<h3> Types of Cloud </h3>

There are various types of Cloud.

<b>Private Cloud:</b>
-	Having our own cloud and deploy it internally for our own use. 
-	Private cloud employs cloud computing within a company’s own local or wide area network.

<b>Public Cloud:</b> 
-	A cloud computing service on the internet available for general public use.
-	Example cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, GCP etc.

<b>Hybrid Cloud:</b>

- A hybrid cloud is one in which applications are running in a combination of different environments
-	The use of both private and public cloud for our company needs is known as hybrid cloud.

<b>Multi-Cloud: </b>
-	 Use of multiple cloud providers simultaneously in order to meet our company/orgs. Computing needs.

<b>Challenges before Cloud</b>

-	Requires a lot of resources to manage data center manually.
-	High cost to manage, monitor infrastructure and teams. 
-	Maintenance cost.
-	Scalability issues, limited or no scalability, can lead to downtimes. 
-	Natural calamity may cause issues to the infrastructure.
-	Monolithic Architecture was commonly used before cloud which has a number of disadvantages over a micro services based application running on a cloud. 


<h2> Why Cloud </h2>

<b>Highly Scalable:</b>

Scalability provides flexibility as required. We can scale up and scale down as per our operation and storage needs. Rather than purchasing fix number of resources and buying high cost storages which remains unused can cost heavy for us. Scalability is managed by our service providers as per our desired number of instances that can be scaled up and down dynamically as required. We only pay of the resources that are being used (pay as you go).

<b>Highly Flexible: </b>

The cloud offers businesses more flexibility overall versus hosting on a local server. And, if you need extra bandwidth then a cloud-based service can meet up your requirement instantly, rather than undergoing a complex (and expensive) update to your IT infrastructure

<b>High Availability:</b>

There are networks of servers on the cloud if one downtimes. The data or services are being transferred to the other available servers which ensures high availability without experiencing downtimes.

<b> Disaster Recovery: </b>

One of the factors that contribute to the success of a business is controlling the resources. Unfortunately, no matter how in control your organization maybe when it comes to its own processes, there will always be things that are completely out of your control, and the Downtime in your services leads to lost productivity, revenue, and organization reputation so, there is something you can do to help to speed up your recovery. Cloud services provide quick data recovery for all kinds of emergency scenarios, from natural disasters to power outages.

<b> Fault Tolerance :</b>
The term “High Availability” refers to a system (a network, database, storage, and a server array or cluster, etc.) that is designed to avoid loss of service by reducing or managing failures of the equipment and minimizing planned downtime. In an organization, the system is expected to be highly available when life, health, and well-being – including economic well-being – are at stake.





<h2> Cloud Service Model </h2>

<b>Infrastructure as a Service:</b> 

It is the most flexible service in which we can rent out the most basic infrastructure service. Such as hardware, servers, VMs, networks and Operating systems. It gives complete control over the hardware.
It gives flexibility, management control over our IT infrastructure.
Example: EC2, virtual machines, storages. 

<b>Platform as a Service:</b>

Platform as a service gives developers a ready to use development environment. Where developers write codes in order to develop applications.
PaaS will help us to create an application quickly without managing the underlying infrastructure. For example, when deploying a web application using PaaS, we don’t have to install the OS, web server, or even system patching. However, we can scale the resources and add new features to our services. 
Example: Firebase, Lambda, elastic beanstalk, oracle cloud database.

<b>Software as a Service:</b>

Saas provides us with a complete product to run a fully managed by the service provider.
Softwares are hosted online and are available to customers on the subscription basis or to purchase in the cloud service model.
We don’t need to worry about the underlying infrastructure or services which are being maintained in the back.
Examples: Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Drive, Gmail, Dropbox.
