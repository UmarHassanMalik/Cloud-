<h2> AWS Trusted Advisor </h2>

AWS Trusted Advisor provides suggestions to us to follow AWS best practices. Trusted Advisor evaluates our account by using checks. The different checks find ways to optimize our AWS infrastructure (Services), optimize performance and security, reduce costs, and monitor service limits, fault tolerence. We can act according to these incoming recommendations to optimize our services and resources.



<h3> Advantages </h3> 

<b> Optmization of Cost:</b>
  
Trusted Advisor can help us save cost with actionable recommendations by analyzing usage, configuration and spend. For instance identifying unused Database instances , underutilized EBS volumes, unlinked and unused Elastic IP addressess.

<b> Service Monitoring (Limits and Quotas) </b>

The maximum number of resources that we can use in AWS is know as service quota/limit.  AWS implements quotas to provide highly available and reliable service to all users, and protects us from spending by mistake. Trusted Advisor will notify us once we reach more than 80% of a service quota. We can then follow recommendations to delete resources or request a quota increase. This helps us to effectively use the AWS resources in terms of cost and avoid any useless spendings. 

<b>Fault tolerance </b>
  
Trusted Advisor help us to improve the reliability of our services. For instance monitoring VPN tunnel redundancy, Auto scaling EC2 groups, deleted health checks on Route 53, disabled Availability Zones, load balancer optimization, zmazon S3 bucket versioning, amazon aurora DB instance accessibility etc. 
  
<b> Performance </b>
  
Trusted Advisor can help improve the performance of our built infrastructure with various suggestions by analyzing usage and configuration.Like Include analyzing EBS throughput and latency, compute usage of EC2 instances, and configurations on CloudFront.

<b> Security </b>

Trusted Advisor can help improve the security of our AWS environment by suggesting foundational security best practices curated by security experts. For example identifying RDS security group access risk, exposed access keys, and unnecessary S3 bucket permissions, IAM - Use of Roles/Users, key rotation, root account MFA, password policy.
