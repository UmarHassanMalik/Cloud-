Cloud Computing # 2  




Difference between the deployment Models.



| On Premises (Private)     | Public Cloud |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| In on premises (Single Organization) environment resources are deployed within our (enterprise) IT infrastructure. So that enterprise is responsible in maintaining the solution and it’s all processes     | In public cloud computing environment resources are hosted on the premises of service provider and enterprise are able to access those resources and use as much as they want.      |
| <b>Cost:</b> Enterprises themselves are responsible for the cost of server hardware, power consumption and space.   | <b>Cost:</b> Enterprises that are using cloud computing model only need to pay for the resources they use. No maintenance cost and the cost adjusts up and down depends on how much resources are being used.       |
| <b>Control:</b> Enterprises retain their data and fully control of what happens to it. The companies having security and privacy concerns always hesitate to get into public cloud due to this reason. | <b>Control:</b> Critical data and encryption resides in the 3rd party cloud provider. If anything happens unexpectedly we are most likely going to face downtimes. We won’t be able to access that data. |     
| <b>Security:</b> Our data and applications are stored in our infrastructure i.e. firewalls and network security layers/ protocols. Its better suited to have sensitive data being stored and processed in private/on premises. |<b> Security:</b> IT companies find that public cloud security is not a good fit for their businesses. There are different reasons like CSP security is not up to the par, inadequate visibility.  |
