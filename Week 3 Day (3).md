<h2> Amazon Redshift </h2>
Amazon Redshift Serverless provides data warehouse capacity and intelligent scaling with simple configuration and management.
We can access and analyze data without setting up a provisioned data warehouse.

Initially, we create a data warehouse is to launch a set of nodes, called an Amazon Redshift cluster. After we provision our cluster, we can upload your data set and then perform data analysis queries. Regardless of the size of the data set, Amazon Redshift offers fast query performance using the same SQL-based tools and business intelligence applications.
