<h3> Understanding SAAS </h3> 

- SaaS can be used to define a service, business or delivery model. The problem is what it means to be SaaS is not unviversally understood. 
- There is some confusion that what it means to be SaaS but on the other hand there is some concensus on some core fundamentals of SAAS. There are variations like how different people see SaaS.
- The objective is to provide a collection of basic insights that provide customers with a clearer view of the options they should consider as they look to adopt a SaaS delivery model.


<h3> SAAS Business Model </h3>
 
- Running a business in a software as a service (SaaS) model based on goals and scope, can be difficult to define. The terminology and patterns that are used to distinguish SaaS vary based on their origin.
- Adoption of this delivery model is driven by some set of objectives.
- SAAS is about putting in place a mindset and model that targets a specific set of business objectives.

<b> Agility </b>

- Successful startups companies are builtin to continually adapt to the market, customer, and competitive dynamics.
- Great companies always embrace themself with new trends, customers demands, pricing models.

<b> Innovation </b>

 - SaaS is about putting in place the foundational elements that allow us to innovate.
 - We focus and respond to customer needs in our SaaS model. which can vary from time to time.
 
<b> Frictionless onboarding </b> 

- This applies universally to business to business (B2B) and business-to-customer (B2C) customers.
- It doesnot matter which segment or type of customer we support, we still need to be focused on time to value for our customers. 
- The shift to a service-centric model requires the SaaS business to focus on all aspects of the customer experience, with specific emphasis on the repeatability and efficiency of the overall onboarding lifecycle
 
<b> Growth  </b> 

- SaaS companies are more focused to their growth. Inshort they adopt growth centric strategy.
- Aligning all the moving parts of the organization around agility and efficiency gives SaaS organizations the ability to target a growth model.
- The business will also view these as foundational to the long-term growth and success of our SaaS offering.

 
<b> Operational efficiency </b> 

- SaaS companies rely on operational efficiency to promote scale and agility.
- This means putting into place a culture and tooling that is focused on creating an operational footprint that promotes frequent and rapid release of new features.
- It also means having a single, unified experience that allows us to manage, operate, and deploy all customer environments collectively. 

<b> Market Response </b>

- SaaS relies on its agility to give the organization the ability to react and respond to market dynamics in near real-time.


<b> SaaS Delivery Model Key Objectives Summary </b> 

SaaS is a business and software delivery model that gives organizations the ability to offer their solutions in a low-friction, service-centric model that maximizes value for customers and providers. It relies on agility and operational efficiency as pillars of a business strategy that promotes growth, reach, and innovation.

<b>SaaS A Service not a Product </b>

- In a service-centric model, we think more about how customers are onboarded to our service, how quickly they achieve value, and how rapidly we can introduce features that address customer needs. Details associated with how our service is built, operated, and managed are out of our customer’s view.

<b> Example </b> 

Suppose we’re in a restaurant, we certainly care about the food, but we also care about the service. How quickly does our server come to our table, how often do they refill our water, how fast does the food come—these are all measures of the service experience. This is the same mindset and value system that should shape how we think about building a SaaS service.

<h3> SaaS Impact to Our Business </h3>

This as-a-service model should have a heavy influence on how we build our teams and our service. Our backlog of work will now put these experience attributes on equal or higher footing than features and functions. The business will also view these as foundational to the long-term growth and success of our SaaS offering.

<h3> SaaS Authentication </h3>

SaaS adds new considerations to our application’s identity model. As each user is authenticated, they must be connected to a specific tenant context. This tenant context provides essential information about our tenant that is used throughout our SaaS environment. Example tokens, ID. It is used for user and tenant identity. Token from this identity process flows into the microservices of our application and create tenant aware logs, record metrics, meter billing, enforce tenant isolation etc.

  

<h3> Building SAAS Multi-tenant Solutions on AWS </h3>

Multi-tenancy is used to describe how resources are shared by tenants to promote agility and cost efficiency.

Suppose, for example if we have a microservice or an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance that is consumed by multiple tenants of our SaaS system. This service would be viewed as running in a multi-tenant model, because tenants are sharing use of the infrastructure that runs this service.

We can manage tenents (profiles) to distribute and partition tenant data, applying security policies in order to prevent cross-tenant access, SaaS implementation, highlighting the tradeoffs and considerations that can shape our approach to SaaS architecture.

<b> Tenancy Isolation </b>

- In **Silo Model** tenants sharing a few resources, with a boon to data security and a draw on efficiency. Likewise, the pool model is a more efficient use of resources at the expense of keeping tenants strictly separated.
- The **Bridge Model**, on the other hand, is a hybrid of the two.
- The **Pool Model** is much more common than the silo sees users sharing some or all infrastructure resources.
