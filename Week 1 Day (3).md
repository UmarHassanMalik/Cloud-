<h2> Introduction </h2>

<b>AWS Services:</b>

-	Compute 
-	Storage
-	Blockchain
-	AI 
-	Network Security
-	Machine Learning
-	Robot Development

<b>Client Server Model:</b>

User generates a request through application (Client side). A virtual server (EC2 instance(s)) handles and responds to the request as per the business logic. A client is the way that the person interact with the server. 
The business stake holders only pay of the resources they are using. So it’s a pay as you go. 

<b>Cloud Computing: </b>

-	Cloud computing is the on demand delivery of the IT services over the internet with the pay as you go pricing. 
-	AWS offers numerous services which are required commonly across all the businesses. For example My SQL, Mongo DB databases. 
<h3> Why AWS has so many products (services)?</h3>
If there are IT elements which are common across all the businesses then this is not the differentiator between competitors For Example using MySQL engine does not give a business an edge over its competitor but the “Data” which is being stored in that SQL database is what differentiate a business in the competition. So these services/resources (database) which are common in every business are provided by AWS commonly known as “undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT”. 

 <b>Benefits; </b>

Cloud Computing gives us benefits such as 
-	Security 
-	Cost Savings
-	Flexibility
-	Scalability

<b> Payment Model:</b>
-	The payment model is flexible. We don’t need to invest in data centers, servers and resources and their maintenance
-	It varies as we grow in terms of expense. So we use more resources as we grow. 

<b>Global Reach:</b>
-	AWS has data centers almost all over the world.
-	It allows us to deploy our applications quickly.
-	It allows your customers to access your app quickly.
-	You can select the regions yourself while targeting your clients region (nearest) which will reduce the latency for the clients to access your application.

<b>Reduction in Operations:</b>
-	Establishing/having our own data centers & servers will require huge amount of resources/investment and staffing.
-	Cloud Computing reduces our operation and let us focus only the crucial components of our business, application.

<b>Flexible Capacity:</b>
-	While having our own data centers and serves will lead us to have unused capacity and limitations.
-	With cloud computing we can grow freely and faster. We pay of what we use.

<b>Less Cost:</b>
-	In cloud computing we share resource.
-	Sharing/Pooling the infrastructure with thousands of customers around the world lowers the cost of the resources that are being used.

<b>Increased Speed:</b>

-	Flexibility allows us to develop and deploy applications quickly. 
-	It allows us to access resources quickly.
-	We use resources instantly which consequently allows the businesses to grow at a rapid rate. Businesses experiments and invent more.
-	Ultimately it allows us to access the resources quickly.
